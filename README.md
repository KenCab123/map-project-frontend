Using the NYPD Shooting Incidents Data API as part of the NYC Open API database, we -- Tim Natal, Ken Cabral and Marlon Regis, tackled this project over only a couple of days to create an app, `BulletProof NYC` to solve the problem of NYC gun violence, and solving it through safety awareness around the data provided by the NYPD of shooting incidents in its 5 boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island.

## The Data  

-5 Different NYC Boroughs
-Death by Shooting (classified as "murder")
-Date & Time
-Direct Location: (indoors or outdoors?)
-Perpetrator (age, sex, race)
-Victim (age, sex, race)

### Features
-The `BulletProof NYC` app is a simple one, providing statistics on the above data, by borough, broken-down. A user can hover and click over each borough to get 'the skinny' as it relates to shootings, to date.

## USER STORIES

1. The app should be free to download, informative and be available on any mobile device.

2. As a user, we also want an exact location of shooting incidents within each borough.

3. As a user, reporting a gun sighting, incident or murder should be possible on the app, directly to the NYPD.

4. As a repeat user, hopefully updates are showing new data and trends of gun violence by the borough.

5. As an avid user, the app needs to point me in the right direction for news feeds about gun violence, tracks up-to-the-hour NYPD posts on social media platforms on gun violence, as well as research sources on shootings in NYC.


## User Persona:

-King David is an Uber Driver in NYC, who lives in Queens.
-He drives throughout the 5 boroughs of NYC, on a daily basis.
-Similar to tourists & dependent on navigation, our app creates awareness, which in turn provides a precaution for your safety. 
-He uses our app from time-to-time, to get updates on current trends in gun violence according to each of the 5 boroughs.
-Mostly active during the night, guess where he limits his rides?
-According to the data provided in our app, he turns off his Uber app after a drop-off destination, once he's taken to the Bronx. 
-& his BulletProof NYC app icon sits right next to his Uber app.
